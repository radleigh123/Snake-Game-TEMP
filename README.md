# Snake Game

## Getting Started

The authors have collaborated to create a simple yet engaging Java snake game. This game features a snake that players control using keyboard inputs to navigate through a grid-based environment. The objective is to eat apple scattered across the grid while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. The game offers an enjoyable experience for players and showcases the skills of both the authors as BSIT students.
